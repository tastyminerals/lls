**lls** is a sript that works as **ls** with additional info on files, spiced with some fancy colors.
Its a simple  **ls** command alternative, that I made for my own use, while learning BASH.

The thing is that by default **ls** doesn't use "--color" mode, nor does it use the "--group-directories-first" mode. **lls** solves this, providing pleasant colorful highlighting and some easy-to-read permission TAGS.
**lls** can draw basic folder trees with a total files and dirs number inside too.

In addition, **lls** shows some basic file info. **lls** doesn't use **ls** for the inside file processing, it does use **find**)

Feel free to use or bitterly criticize^^
