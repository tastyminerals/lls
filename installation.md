# Installation #
**lls** is a small 12K script for **Linux**. Assuming that, linux users can put it wherever they like, in their $PATH. I personally keep it in /usr/local/sbin/.

I've added custom color support, so **lls** now has its own config file called **.llsrc**, which is generated by **lls** automatically.

To get it go to download page. And follow the instructions below:

1) download the .tar archive

2) cd to your download directory

3) sudo cp lls /usr/local/sbin

5) Enjoy!
