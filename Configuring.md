# Colorizing the lls output #

You can make **lls** use the colours that you want.
I've added a **.llsrc** file in version 0.6, in which you can easily set up your own color theme for **lls**.

Here are the colours you may use:

_black_
_dark\_gray_
_blue_
_light\_blue_
_green_
_light\_green_
_cyan_
_light\_cyan_
_red_
_light\_red_
_purple_
_light\_purple_
_yellow_
_light\_yellow_
_light\_gray_
_white_

Example:

_o\_dir=$blue_ -- where _o\_dir_ is an option for a directory colour.


_o\_dir\_tag=$blue_ -- is an option for a directory tag (DIR open) colour.

Replace it with your colour like this:

_o\_dir=$white_

_o\_dir\_tag=$light\_purple_

And it is done!, run **lls** and see the result.
