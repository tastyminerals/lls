lls is a sript that works as ls with additional info on files, spiced with some fancy colors. Its a simple "ls" command alternative, that I made for my own use, while learning BASH.

lls provides pleasant colorful highlighting, file info and some easy-to-read permission TAGS. In addition lls can draw folder trees with a total files/dirs count.
